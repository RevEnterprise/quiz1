          Batang Regency is a regency-level administrative region located along the northern coast of Central Java Province, Indonesia. The town of Batang, which serves as a district-level administrative unit within the regency, functions as both the administrative capital and the financial center. The town center lies along the famous North Coast Trans-Java Highway network, also known as Pantura. At the center of the town square stands a large old ficus tree, which has become one of the regency’s icons despite having partially collapsed.

          The regency features both coastal and mountainous landscapes. It borders the Java Sea to the north, Kendal Regency to the east, Banjarnegara Regency to the south, and both Pekalongan City and Pekalongan Regency to the west. Covering a total area of 857.21 km² and with a population of 849,686 (as of mid-2024), Batang Regency ranks below average in size and population compared to other regencies and cities in Central Java Province.

      <p>
        The existence of Batang Regency can be divided into three distinct periods. The first period lasted from the 17th century until December 31, 1935, during which Batang stood as an independent regency. The second period began on January 1, 1936, when Batang Regency was incorporated into neighboring Pekalongan Regency. This situation remained in place despite several proposals to re-establish Batang as an independent regency, dating back as early as 1946. In 1952, the Batang Regency Restoration Committee (Panitia Pengembalian Kabupaten Batang) was formed. After years of discussions and persistent efforts, Batang Regency was successfully re-established as a Level II Region on April 8, 1966. Since then, Batang has functioned as a regency with a regent (bupati) as its head and a Regional People’s Representative Council (DPRD), a status it maintains to this day.
