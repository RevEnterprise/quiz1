            Kali Kuto Bridge is a 100-meter-long bridge on the Semarang–Batang Toll Road and is one of the most recognizable structures in Batang, thanks to its red arch design. Construction began in mid-2017, and the bridge was officially inaugurated by President Joko Widodo in December 2018, alongside the opening of the Semarang–Batang Toll Road. It should be noted that stopping on the bridge is strictly prohibited except in emergencies, as it poses safety risks. Nevertheless, the bridge has become a well-known local landmark for travelers along the toll road and local.
